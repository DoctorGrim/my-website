          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Computer programing scratches both a creative and logical itch at the
            same time. Being able to create something new that will be useful is
            satisfying, but so is solving the logic puzzles themselves. I have
            always been a computer hobbyist and eventually couldn’t resist diving
            deeper into how the software was made. Before I turned to programming
            I gathered some valuable background. In 2012 I organized a trip to
            China and nearby countries. In Xian, I worked for 12 weeks with
            orphaned infants with special needs. I learned from putting together
            the complex logistics of such a trip, but also, from being immersed in
            such a different cultural and vocational setting. After graduating in
            Neuroscience at the University of Southern California in 2015, where I
            had the opportunity to participate in brain research, I went on for a
            Masters in bioimaging at Boston University. In those settings I
            learned to use MATLAB and R for running fMRI experiments and
            statistical analyses. In my scientific research I have also learned
            how to shift through copious documentation, and as a floor manager at
            a retail outlet I learned to work with and help manage a team of
            people.

            In the summer of 2019, at Burlington Code Academy, I learned the MERN
            stack using mongoDB express react and node to create projects. We also
            learned workflow practices such as using git for version control and
            agile. As my capstone project, my team worked with You Need A Budget
            (YNAB) to bring Google Assistant functionality to their program. Now,
            with our extension, you can use voice activation to check your
            balance, add a transaction, and manage your budget. We are currently
            in alpha testing and will have a full release soon. In this project we
            used Dialogueflow and Firebase to integrate with YNAB API.

            I am a member of the local group, Code for BTV, where I collaborate
            with other programmers on civic software and open data projects for
            governmental and private organizations in Vermont. For example, I am
            working on Money On My Mind, an app that will help people complete the
            Financial Futures program that helps qualifying Vermonters learn more
            about money management, building financial stability, and increasing
            household savings. Next, I will be working on an app to help
            Vermonters find out where to vote. In my spare time, I help to
            organize meetings of Burlington’s board game community. Our group now
            has over 90 members and counting. You can check us out on
