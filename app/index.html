        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Computer programing scratches both a creative and logical itch at the
          same time. Being able to create something new that will be useful is
          satisfying, but so is solving the logic puzzles themselves. I have
          always been a computer hobbyist and eventually couldn’t resist diving
          deeper into how the software was made.

          In the summer of 2019, at Burlington Code Academy, I learned the MERN
          stack using mongoDB, express, react and node to create projects. We
          also learned workflow practices such as using git for version control
          and agile. As my capstone project, my team worked with You Need A
          Budget (YNAB) to bring Google Assistant functionality to their
          program.

          I am a member of the local group, Code for BTV, where I collaborate
          with other programmers on civic software and open data projects for
          governmental and private organizations in Vermont. For example, I am
          working on Money On My Mind, an app that will help people complete the
          Financial Futures program that helps qualifying Vermonters learn more
          about money management, building financial stability, and increasing
          household savings. In my spare time, I also help to organize meetings of
          Burlington’s board game community. Our group now has over 100 members
          and counting. You can check us out on
          <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Strategy-by-the-Lake-Games-Calendar/"
